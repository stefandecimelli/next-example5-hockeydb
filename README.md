# Database Application

To get the stats for a team, run the following command:
```
./getteamStats.sh "maple leafs"
```
or just
```
./getteamStats.sh leafs
```
You can also get an individuals stats:
```
./getPlayerStats.sh "auston matthews"
```
or
```
./getPlayerStats.sh 34
```

## Todo
I'll make a Next.js app for inserting and deleting later. This is just te data schema for now.
